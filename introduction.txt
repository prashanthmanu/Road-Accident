As cities across the world grow and the mobility of populations increases, there
has also been a corresponding increase in the number of vehicles on roads. The 
result of this has been a proliferation of challenges for authorities with 
regard to road traffic management. A consequence of this has been congestion 
of traffic, more accidents, and pollution. Accidents are a still major cause of
 death, despite the development of sophisticated systems for traffic management 
and other technologies linked with vehicles. Hence, it is necessary that a 
common system for road accident management is developed. Road accident 
management is the centralized handling of a motorist’s claim following a road 
traffic collision or other damages or mishaps that happen to a vehicle while on
 or off road. It has been proven that vehicle accidents are one of the main 
causes of fatalities with more than 100 deaths being reported in the India on a
 daily basis. The report indicates that the year 2007 experienced more than 
43,000 deaths as a result of over 10 million reported accidents. Moreover, in 
most of the countries in the world, a major cause of accidents is poor
infrastructure for managing traffic. The concept of traffic management systems 
refers to intelligent public transport mechanisms founded on information 
obtained in real-time.
